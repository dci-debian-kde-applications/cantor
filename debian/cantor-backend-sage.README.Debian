Sage backend for Cantor for Debian
----------------------------------

At the moment, Sage is not available in Debian, so you need to manually
install it for making cantor-backend-sage useful.
Cantor will use Sage automatically if the `sage' executable is in $PATH
(so `which sage' returns its path); if it is not, you can set the path to the
locally installed `sage' in the preferences of the Sage backend of Cantor.
