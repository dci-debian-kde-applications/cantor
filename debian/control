# cantor-backend-r
Description: interface for mathematical applications
 Cantor is an application to allow you to you use your favorite mathematical
 applications from within an elegant KDE-integrated worksheet interface. It
 provides dialogs to assist with common tasks and allows you to share your
 worksheets with others.
 .
 Cantor supports various mathematical applications as backends (provided in
 external packages):
  * KAlgebra (cantor-backend-kalgebra)
  * Maxima Computer Algebra System (cantor-backend-maxima)
#  * R Project for Statistical Computing (cantor-backend-r)
  * Sage Mathematics Software (cantor-backend-sage)
  * Octave (cantor-backend-octave)
 .
 This package is part of the KDE education module.
