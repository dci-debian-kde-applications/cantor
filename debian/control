Description: interface for mathematical applications
 Cantor is an application to allow you to you use your favorite mathematical
 applications from within an elegant worksheet interface. It provides dialogs
 to assist with common tasks and allows you to share your worksheets
 with others.
 .
 Cantor supports various mathematical applications as backends (provided in
 external packages):
  * Maxima Computer Algebra System (cantor-backend-maxima)
  * R Project for Statistical Computing (cantor-backend-r)
  * Sage Mathematics Software (cantor-backend-sage)
  * Octave (cantor-backend-octave)
